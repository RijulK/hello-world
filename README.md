# hello-world
This is a repository that will help me get a job...eventually

Hi, I am Rijul, learning about Github and eventually R programming.  I am freaking out a bunch because of the whole not having a job thing, but I need to stay positive.  I am going to get a job and have the opportunity to pick up some new skillsets now and really work hard and make some changes in life.  

This is my time for committment
